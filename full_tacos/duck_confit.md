# Duck Confit Tacos

Completely decadent and over the top.

* You can buy the duck confit legs or make your own using your favorite recipe.
* Brown duck confit in a skillet.  Shred.
* Serve in flour shells.
* Top with a selection of the following:
  - wine braised red cabbage (with or without apple)
  - chopped granny smith apples sautéed in duck fat with a dash of cider vinegar
  - swiss chard or kale sautéed in duck fat with garlic
  - mushrooms (a mixture is best) sautéed in duck fat
  - red currant or pomegranate sauce (melted jam or chutneys work well)
